# Welcome to instagram-data-analysis repository 

## About 

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Instagram data from [Statso](https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order form: 

1. [Data Extraction]
2. [Data Resampling]
3. [Linear Regression]
4. [Words-correlation]

## Contributors 

- @Ayyriel - Natural Language Processing 
- @JingRonggg - Data Extraction & Data Visualisation
- @negnij - Boot Strapping, Linear Regression  

## Problem Definition 
- Which hashtag, captions and caption length yield the highest impression and engagement(likes, comments, shares)?
- Is there any correlation between Caption Length and engagement(likes, comments, shares) & impression?

## Models Used 

1. Linear Regression
2. Natural Language Processing (LLM)

## Conclusion 
- There is no correlation between caption length and engagement(likes, comments, shares) & impression
- Likes and Shares are correlated to Impressions
- Bootstrapping our data resulted in the sample being too random and hence, unable to find the correlation
- Linear Regression did not perform well with our bootstrapped data
- Using #explained, #solved, #certification will likely result in the highest impression and engagement(likes, comments, shares)

## What did we learn from this project? 
- Handling insufficent data using bootstrapping methods 
- Natural Language Processing, Use of nlkt library
- Concepts about Stemming, Lemmatization and Tokenizing under Natural Language Processing
- Collaborating using GitHub
